### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Facundo Carballo
#### I'm student of Computer Engineering at UNLAM
I like to create apps for my own that can be useful for other people.
</br>
## Skills
I like to use Flutter or any other framework that allows you design the UI in a declarative way. I feel much more productive working in this way because I can focus in what I like most that it's create the logic of the app.
